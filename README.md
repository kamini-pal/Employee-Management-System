# TaskFlow - Task Management Web App

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
TaskFlow is a **task management web application** built using **React.js and Tailwind CSS**. It allows an **admin** to assign tasks to employees, track progress, and manage workload efficiently. Employees can view their assigned tasks and update statuses as **New, Completed, Failed, or Accepted**.

## ðŸš€ Features
### Admin Dashboard:
- Assign tasks with **title, employee name, description, category, and date**.
- Track and manage assigned tasks in real-time.
- View task progress categorized by status.

### Employee Dashboard:
- View assigned tasks with details.
- Update task status (**New, Completed, Failed, Accepted**).
- Organize and manage tasks efficiently.

### Additional Features:
- **Modern UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a sleek and responsive design.
- **Real-time State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useEffect) for smooth data updates.
- **Fully Responsive**: Works seamlessly across all devices.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
